about-blurb: <p><strong>I have spent the majority of my career in post production
             visual effects and developing tools and software for that field.</strong>
            <br>&emsp; For almost 6 years I had the good fortune to work in 3 of the large
            production houses in London (Double Negative, Framestore and MPC) where
             I honed my skills as an artist.
            <br>&emsp; I then moved from post production to working for The Foundy who develop 
            some of the software used by these companies and other industries.
            <br>&emsp; I started as a QA engineer for Mari and quickly moved into other roles, finally 
            finding my way to my current position as a Python Developer on a Modo project 
            for a global shoe manufacurer.</p>
